## Installing 'rmarkdown' Package

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```


#Seting global options:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Note that the code above will not be run or evaluated
due to "include=FALSE" option

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressureplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Code Chunk Parameters

There are many other paramaters for code chunks:

Rule          | Example          | Function
     
eval	          eval=TRUE          Is the code run and the results included in the output?
include	        include=TRUE	     Are the code and the results included in the output?
echo	          echo=TRUE	         Is the code displayed alongside the results?
warning	        warning=TRUE	     Are warning messages displayed?
error	          error=FALSE	       Are error messages displayed?
message	        message=TRUE	     Are messages displayed?
tidy	          tidy=FALSE	       Is the code reformatted to make it look “tidy”?
results	        results="markup"	 How are results treated?
                                   "hide" = no results
                                   "asis" = results without formatting
                                   "hold" = results only compiled at end of chunk 
                                            (use if many commands act on one object)
cache	          cache=FALSE	       Are the results cached for future renders?
comment	        comment="##"	     What character are comments prefaced with?
fig.width       fig.width=7        What width (in inches) are the plots?  
fig.height	    fig.height=5       What height (in inches) are the plots?
fig.align	      fig.align="left"	 How is figure aligned? Can be "left" "right" "center"

## Inserting Figures

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
df <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(df)
```

## Inserting Tables

You can just print a dataframe instead of a table

```{r carstable}
cars
```

Or you can use kable function:

```{r echo = FALSE }
library(knitr)
kable(df, digits = 2)
```

You can create a table manually using R Markdown: 

| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |

Here's the syntax for alignment:

`:----:`	Centre
`:-----`	Left
`-----:`	Right
`------`	Auto

Tables can also be created using 'stargazer'package

```{r}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(attitude, type = "html")
```

## Other Elements of R Syntax

*Italic*

**Bold**

Bold

This is `code` in text


# Header 1

## Header 2

Note that when a # symbol is placed inside a code chunk it acts as a normal R comment, but when placed in text it controls the header size.

* Unordered list item

1. Ordered list item
